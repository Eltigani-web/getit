# AI Agents

This project utilizes AI agents to assist with development, refactoring, and documentation.

## Overview

The agents operate within the `.sisyphus` and `.gemini` directories (ignored from version control) to:
- Plan complex implementations.
- Maintain context across sessions.
- Execute coding tasks.

## Configuration

Agent configurations are local and not shared in the public repository to prevent leakage of specific workflow preferences or local paths.
